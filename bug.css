The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations, but it can sometimes lead to unexpected results if parentheses are not used correctly or if incompatible units are mixed. For example, `width: calc(100% - 10px)` is correct, but `width: calc(100% - 10)` (missing 'px' unit) will cause issues. Another common mistake is nesting `calc()` expressions without proper parentheses, leading to misinterpretations of the order of operations.
